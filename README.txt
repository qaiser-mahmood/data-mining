To get this program up and running locally on your computer:
Set up the Python development environment. Virtual environment with Python3 is recommended.

I have used only those packages that were allowed / recommended by Sonny. These packages are supposed
to be installed on VM already.

Just in case, I have included requirements.txt file that list down all the packages required to run
the program.

Make sure you are in the project directory, where run.py and requirements.txt files are located.

To run the program use following command:
python3 run.py

If you don't have all or some of the packages they can be installed by following command:
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
